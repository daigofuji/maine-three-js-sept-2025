# Hitting the wall with Three.js (for me)

- Awesome! Beautiful!
- Don't have to write raw WebGL code

## ...but
- Still lots of code, imperative API
- Manual DOM manipulation
- Complex scene management
- Repetitive boilerplate code
- Hard to integrate with React apps

# What is WebGL?

- **Plugin-free 3D graphics:** Renders 3D graphics directly in your browser without needing any extra software or plugins.

- **Based on an industry standard:** Built on OpenGL ES, a widely-used standard for portable graphics.

# A Brief History of HTML canvas and WebGL

- 2004: Apple introduces the `<canvas>` element.

- 2006: Mozilla engineer Vladimir VukiÄ‡eviÄ‡ begins prototyping 3D graphics within `<canvas>`.

- 2009: The Khronos Group forms the WebGL working group, bringing together major tech companies to standardize the technology.

- 2011: WebGL 1.0 is released.

- 2014: The HTML5 specification standardizes `<canvas>`, solidifying its role as a key part of the modern web.

<p class="text-sm">SOURCES: <a href="https://architosh.com/2019/02/webgl-2-0-why-its-the-path-to-stable-open-standards-based-3d-web-graphics/">Architosh</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/">Khronos Group</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">Mozilla Developer Network</a></p>

Something clever about web standard and how it enables cross-platform 3D graphics.

<!-- Khronos group included major tech companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm -->

# Three.js TL;DR ðŸŒŸ

- A JavaScript library that lets you create 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL, so that no need to write raw WebGL code.

- WebGL Abstraction: No need to write raw WebGL code/GPU assembly code

- Lights/Shadows: Built-in support.

- Geometries/Materials: Predefined shapes (cubes, spheres, planes etc.) and surface appearances.

# Three.js Core Concepts/Minimum set up

- **Scene**: Container for all 3D objects Your 3D world (holds objects, lights, cameras).
- **Camera**: Viewpoint into 3D world  
- **Renderer**: Draws the 3D scene onto a `<canvas>` element.
- **Objects & Lights**: 3D models (meshes = geometry + material) and lighting

---

# Enter React Three Fiber

pmnd.rs or Poimandres, is an open-source developer collective. They create and maintain useful tools for the React ecosystem, including React Three Fiber.

- React *renderer* for Three.js (not just a wrapper)
- **Core Idea:** It translates declarative JSX into imperative Three.js commands for you.
- Component-based architecture
- Automatic cleanup & lifecycle management
- Same Three.js objects, better DX

## Analogy
- Imperative = HOW (The step-by-step recipe)
- Declarative = WHAT (The final order)

# Code Comparison

**Vanilla Three.js (20+ lines):**
```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, width/height, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({color: 0xff6b9d});
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);
// ... more setup code
```

::right::
**React Three Fiber (8 lines):**
```jsx
<Canvas>
  <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
  <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
  <mesh>
    <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
    <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
  </mesh>
</Canvas>
```

# Why R3F Finally Clicked

- Familiar React patterns
- Declarative approach I already knew
- No more manual DOM manipulation
- Component reusability
- All React hooks are already available (e.g., useState, onClick)
- added hooks like useFrame, useLoader, and useThree, as well as onPointerOver/onPointerOut etc.
- Great developer experience
- But there's more! Amazing ecosystem

# Power of Drei (@react-three/drei)

- A collection of useful helpers and abstractions for R3F
- Simplifies common tasks (e.g., loading models, handling events)
- Encourages best practices and performance optimizations
- Easily load 3D models like GLTF formats (.glb files) using [useGLTF](https://drei.docs.pmnd.rs/loaders/gltf-use-gltf).
- Easily make a text into 3D objects using [Text](https://drei.docs.pmnd.rs/abstractions/text) and [Text3D](https://drei.docs.pmnd.rs/abstractions/text3d)

---

# Simple Demo 

```jsx
<Canvas>
  <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
  <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
  <mesh>
    <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
    <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
  </mesh>
</Canvas>

# Conclusion & Resources

Recap: R3F makes 3D web development accessible to React developers.

The Workflow: React for logic, state, and composition + Three.js for 3D power.
